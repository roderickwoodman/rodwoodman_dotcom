        <h1>Dinsmore Landscape Company</h1>
        <p>In this website redesign I was allowed to completely overhaul the current design in both look and functionality. I reworked the copy and the information architecture, added my own original photography of the client's properties, and made the site work great on mobile. This project doubled as the final requirement for my USCS Extension Web Design Certificate, so it was a true start-to-finish project for a client that I found myself. I am still getting emails from this client about how happy he is that the new site is generating leads for his business.</p>

					<h2>Step #1: Planning</h2>  	
					<p>The project started out with emails and telephone calls with the client, who 
					is the owner of the business. I determined that the company's brand is one of
					quality and responsiveness, and that their competitive advantage, besides being
					local, is that they also maintain fountains on the properties that they service.
					The goal for the website would be to drive users to contact the company. I 
					collected assets not present on the company website like logos and brochures, 
					and I drafted a requirements document.
					<ul>
						<li>defined client's business and goals
						<li>collected content from client
						<li>drafted requirements document: <span id="tool">Word</span>
					</ul>
					</p>

				  <li><a href="docs/dlc/dlc-2design-wireframes.pdf">wireframes</a>
				</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-8">
					<h2>Step #2: Design</h2>
					<p>It was obvious from the inconsistent design of the assets gathered that the 
					client had no brand focus. So my design would include a prominent logo, matching
					the logo version from their trucks,Â as well as other visuals that communicated 
					quality and responsiveness, like trade association logos, testimonials, and a 
					contact form. It was also necessary to reduce the page count and tighten up the
					information architecture of the website. With the new site map in mind, I walked 
					the client's job sites and took photos of their work in order to 
					replace the poor-quality, unflattering photos of the existing design.  Before
					the photos were all collected, I met with my client and he approved my design.
					<ul>
						<li>drafted a simplified site map: <span id="tool">Omnigraffle</span>
						<li>photographed all new images from client's job sites
						<li>sketched wireframes: <span id="tool">pen and paper!</span>
						<li>mocked up 3 versions of home page design: <span id="tool">Photoshop</span>
						<li>gained client's approval of the my chosen design
					</ul>

					<h2>Step #3: Implementation</h2>
					<p>My implementation goal was to start with a simple, functional website, and to 
					enhance as much as possible as time permitted. The basic div structure using HTML5
					& CSS3 was straightforward to create from scratch, but once I added the responsive 
					elements via media  queries and started testing on mobile devices, single-pixel issues 
					started to consume some time. I got the client's IT company to create a "customerservice"
					email ID for branding improvement. Adding the web form that would trigger this 
					new email took more time than expected because  the hosting company Rackspace 
					required SMTP and not the simple PHP mail() function, and also because I wanted 
					the form submit action to be as seamless of an experience as possible. The other
					big piece was the continual manipulation of images -- sizing, compression, naming,
					and placement to ensure consistency and unity with the copy. I then switched my design live
					after my second meeting with my client, where he approved my implementation.  With
					the luxury of more time I would have enhanced the site further by making the images
					more lively and clickable.
					<ul>
					  <li>used HTML5/CSS3 with jQuery for swappable divs and PHP for contact form: <span id="tool">Dreamweaver
					  <li>created a responsive template
						<li>tweaked behavior and pixels of CSS navbar
						<li>added a contact page with a new web form, hooked up to a new corporate email
						<li>consolidated, reworked, and obtained new sections of copy: <span id="tool">English!</span>
						<li>manipulated image sizing, compression, naming, and placement for consistency and unity with the copy: <span id="tool">Photoshop</span>
						<li>interfaced with the client's IT company for new email provisioning
						<li>gained client's approval of the implementation, and went live: <span id="tool">Dreamweaver</span>
					</ul>
